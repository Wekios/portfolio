<p>Scrap Jump is a endless runner game where the player plays the role of a tire avoiding obstacles by slowing it down. On this project a team of 5 members worked (two programmers, two designers and music composer) . The game is located on a junkyard and obstacles are made up of two parts. The lower part of the old cars that are moving on a conveyor belt and the upper part of the magnet that moves along the rail at the same speed as the lower part of the barrier.</p>
